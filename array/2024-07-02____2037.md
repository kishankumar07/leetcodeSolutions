2037. Minimum number of moves to seat everyone.

seats[3,1,5] = - = students[2,4,7] 

In the above case , the array [3,1,5] is the seat and [2,4,7] is the students array. Both are arrays. 

We have to consider the fact that to get the minimum number of moves between the seat and student and find their sum.

Sot the easiest and straight forward approach was to sort two arrays , so now there is only need to find the corresponding difference of each indexes elements and ultimately their sum which gives us the result. 

Inorder to avoid the negative value , use Math.abs();
