 - For the above question I used the approach of reduce method.
 - The accumulator counts down the number of operations if any.
 - Current value iterates through each value for accumulator to adds up. 
 
 - Time complexity -O(n) because for the increasing elements in array the reduce method has to traverse through each of them 
 - Space complexity - O(1) for increasing input elements in the array only one variable acc is incrementing its value and no other additional variable is added up on.

 - I have given below many approaches using map, filter, reduce, forEach, traditional for loop just to brush up my knowledge of using all the methods I learnt !
