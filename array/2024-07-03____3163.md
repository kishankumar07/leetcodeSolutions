Greetings , and this is the 3rd day of my leetcode challenge , I took the question of finding good pairs.

I think I have attempted this question while I was at brocamp and this was my first question asked at leetcode test.

With my limited knowledge Iam saving this question for later. Iam proceeding to submit with the two loop approach. with O(n*m)
